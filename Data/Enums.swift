üîç Atom: The Fundamental Building Block
At the heart of matter lies the atom, the smallest unit of an element. It consists of a nucleus, composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged electrons in orbit.

‚ö° Electrons: Energetic Participants
Electrons, with a negative charge, orbit the nucleus in distinct energy levels or shells. They are vital in chemical reactions, determining an element's behavior, and are involved in the formation of compounds.

üß≤ Protons: Nucleus Inhabitants
Protons, positively charged particles, reside in the nucleus. The number of protons defines an element's identity, contributing to its atomic number.

üîó Neutrons: The Neutral Balancers
Neutrons, electrically neutral, accompany protons in the nucleus, providing stability and influencing the atom's mass without affecting its charge.

üîÑ Electron Orbits: Defined Pathways
Electrons follow specific orbits or energy levels around the nucleus. Understanding these orbits helps predict an element's reactivity and chemical bonding patterns.
